# IMU Exercise: Introduction

This document will describe the use of the F´ system reference as a reference for the flight software workshop. We will
explore flight software through the lens of F´ and this exercise. In the exercise, we will integrate the
[MPU-6050 IMU](https://learn.adafruit.com/mpu6050-6-dof-accelerometer-and-gyro) into our F´ project with the goal of
generating telemetry.
